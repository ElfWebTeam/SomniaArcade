# Somnia Arcade

Somnia Arcade is a collection of fully on-chain mini-games built for the [Somnia Testnet](https://somnia.network/).  
Every game runs entirely on smart contracts with **provable fairness**, transparent payouts, and minimal off-chain logic.  

The platform is designed for quick, fun gameplay while showcasing Somnia’s speed, low cost, and ability to handle real-time interactive dApps.

## 🔍 Fairness Model

- **Commit-Reveal Randomness:**  
  Games commit a hash of the seed, then reveal after a future block.  
  The revealed blockhash + `prevrandao` ensures no early knowledge.
  
- **On-chain Execution:**  
  All core game logic (card draws, bomb positions, payouts) happens inside the smart contract.

- **Transparent Odds:**  
  Multipliers are calculated with fair odds × (1 - house edge), stored on-chain.

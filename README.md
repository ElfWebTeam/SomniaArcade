## üîç Fairness Model

- **Commit-Reveal Randomness:**  
  Games commit a hash of the seed, then reveal after a future block.  
  The revealed blockhash + `prevrandao` ensures no early knowledge.
  
- **On-chain Execution:**  
  All core game logic (card draws, bomb positions, payouts) happens inside the smart contract.

- **Transparent Odds:**  
  Multipliers are calculated with fair odds √ó (1 - house edge), stored on-chain.
